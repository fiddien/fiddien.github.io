This is Ilma. I’m a human and a full-time learner. One side of me is that I am a Muslimah 🧕 with mathematics training from Institut Teknologi Bandung 🆔. Another side of me is that I’m a persistent believer of the uniqueness and complexity of each one of us. No person can be described so simply like I just did in a few sentences before.

The notion of “understanding the underlying principle of intelligence” fascinates me. I want to dig deep into the why, how, and what is intelligence.

With this interest at heart, now I am studying mathematics and artificial intelligence; particularly invested in graphs/networks, deep learning, and natural language processing. I believe all kinds of languages—verbal, physical, or abstract—are the manifestation of intelligence.

I’m also keen to discuss topics such as personal leadership, philosophy, psychology, history, spirituality and religious studies. I write about these things in this blog. If you find things here interesting, you can reach me through
