<p>
    Ilma Aliya Fiddien is an AI engineer and aspiring scholar exploring the intersections of artificial intelligence, Islamic thought, and educational philosophy. Based in Jakarta, she works in practical AI applications while pursuing deeper questions about how traditional Islamic scholarship might inform contemporary technological challenges, particularly in AI ethics and safety.
</p>

<p>
    She holds a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Institut Teknologi Bandung and an MSc in Speech and Language Processing from the University of Edinburgh. As what Mortimer Adler would call a "demanding reader," she engages seriously with both technical and philosophical literature, seeking to bridge different knowledge traditions. Her recent work includes experimental research on AI debate mechanisms, reflections on Islamic educational philosophy in technological contexts, and explorations of responsible AI development.
