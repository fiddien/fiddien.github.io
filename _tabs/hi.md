# How to Communicate With Me

## Core Principles
I strive to embody the Islamic principle of *qawlan sadida* (clear, direct, truthful speech) in all communications. This means being purposeful, precise, and respectful of everyone's time and energy.

Remember: These are guidelines, not rigid rules. The goal is efficient, respectful collaboration that helps us both succeed.

## Best Ways to Reach Me

### For Time-Sensitive Matters
- ðŸ“± Call or text (WhatsApp) if truly urgent
- State the urgency level and required response time upfront
- Example: "[Urgent-2hrs] Need input on ..."

### For Regular Communications
- ðŸ“§ Email for formal/detailed matters
- ðŸ’¬ WhatsApp for personal matters/brief updates
- I rarely open my social media, so don't expect timely responses there

## Communication Preferences

### When Messaging Me
- Start with your main point/request
- Include any relevant deadlines and share expectations clearly
- Example: "Need your input on X by Friday. Main focus: A, B, C"

### What Works Best
- Clear, concise messages
- Relevant context provided upfront

### What to Avoid
- Vague requests without context
- ["Hey" messages without content](https://nohello.net)
- Last-minute urgent requests (unless truly unavoidable)

## Response Expectations
- Regular responses within 24 hours to 1 week if I have some deadlines
- Urgent matters (clearly marked): Same day as possible

## Meeting Preferences
- Scheduled meetings with clear agenda
- Preference for morning meetings when possible

## My Commitments to You
- Clear, timely communication
- Respect for your time
- Honest feedback when needed

## Working Together
- Let's assume good intentions
- Direct feedback is appreciated
