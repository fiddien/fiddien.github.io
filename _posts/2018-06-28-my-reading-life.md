Or more like… reading goals.

Starting from “reading” a thin, fancy magazine for kids called _Bobo_ (yeah, it is fancy for me) to reading a translated book titled _Aljabar Linear Elementer Versi Aplikasi_ by Anton-Rorres, I could have lying to myself if I said that my reading activity has not its own journey.

As lucky as I am–to have parents that suffocates me with _Bobo_ since I was 3, I look at myself as someone who lacking more “impactful” books on my current mental growth. I always have the urge to consume more insight, more inspirational stories, more scenarios, before I ever experience life by myself. Heh.

Am I too scared?

Set that question aside, I have a lot of books–digital and physical–in my library. Tons of them. Untouched.

Sadly, yes, I have a habit of checking Goodreads, searching for interesting title with adequately good reviews. I often find myself loading the bookstore website, hoping for some discount on some fancy book. Yes, this is not good.

So here I am, trying to reorganize my reading life.

In the spirit of making this impossible list inspired by this guy and this guy, I made a goal that require me to read one book in one week, consecutively, for half a year. Sounds tough. But not impossible. I had read The Hunger Games Trilogy in a week to be honest.

Let’s get into it.

So that’s it! I hope I can keep up this goal. I will updating this post to write a check when I I successfully kill a book in a week. I also plan to write a review for some books, so.. at least I will write more often here.

See you in the end of 2018.
