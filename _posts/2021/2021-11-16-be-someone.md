A lot of miracles will happen in the world if the citizens on earth start just doing what they always preaching.

I believe that also applies to me.

I want to smile more. Then smile 🙂

I always walk straight and steam no-nonsense to the room. But, I want to sit the same. Then sit straight then do no-nonsenses afterwards. Every single time.

As a Muslim, all intentions should be oriented around ibadah (worship). So be it! Be intentional. Stop, observe and think, set your heart and head, then do.

I want to settle one thing. The one. One and one only.

Then settle.

Settle to that abstract, to that belief.

Smile. Straight. No-nonsense.
