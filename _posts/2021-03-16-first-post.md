This is definetely not my first blog post ever, but this is the first time I created a static web page. I found tweaking this site powered by Jekyll and GitHub is really interesting, because I have so many control of how the page will looks like and how it will operates. I hope I can learn more about website development from this project! So exciting!

### Some plan
I maintain few internet online presence, that are:

My LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/ilmaaliyaf

Mainly for listing my academic and career history (and see others'). Sometimes I shared my accomplishment in finishing courses or projects.

My Medium: ilmaaliyaf.medium.com

I use this platform to pour anything (serious) I have in mind. To this date, I haven’t write in few months.

My Instagram: instagram.com/ilmaaliyaf

Instagram Story is such a feature that I cannot resist. I like my thought to be visualized and provided with some caption to give some contexts, but I don’t want to make it “permanent” on the web.

Actually, I don’t like maintaining too much things. But I think it’s important to have personalized web pages to “dump” everything I created, and focus solely on my works (hey, I’m looking at you, Instagram and LinkedIn). Medium is too limiting, in my taste (does that mean it’s better to get rid of it now?). So, after some researchs, I choose static web page.

This site will be populated with:

Technical posts that are the fruits of my learning in artificial intelligence field, especially deep learning and natural language processing.
Project showcase, anything, really.
My activities around my education and career.
Reviews on the books/podcast/courses which I consumed.
Casual thoughts about daily life, probably will be oriented around productivity, religion (Islam), philosophy, psychology, and education.
That’s it!

Bismillah.
