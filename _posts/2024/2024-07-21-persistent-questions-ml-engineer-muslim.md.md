As a machine learning engineer immersed in the cold, calculated logic of artificial intelligence, Iâ€™ve found myself increasingly drawn to the warmth and complexity of spirituality. Itâ€™s a peculiarÂ situation, straddling the line between the tangible world of data and algorithms and the intangible realm of faith and meaning. My days are filled with the exacting demands of building intelligent systems, while my nights are consumed by pondering questions about humanity, consciousness, and our place in the universeâ€Šâ€”â€Šespecially from the teachings of Islam.

Itâ€™s a unique perspective that has forced me to reconcile seemingly contradictory worldviews. On one hand, Iâ€™m fascinated by the potential of AI to solve pressing global challenges. On the other, Iâ€™m deeply concerned about its ethical implications and the existential risks it might pose. This constant tension between optimism and apprehension has led me to explore the deeper philosophical and spiritual dimensions of technology.

(Obvious or not-so-obvious note: Machine learning is only a part of the **interdisciplinary** field of artificial intelligence.)

These are core, philosophical inquiries that drive my exploration:

1. How do our fundamental beliefs about intelligence shape AI research? As I work on machine learning models, I canâ€™t help but wonder: How does my Islamic understanding of the soul and intelligence (spiritualistic) differ from the prevalent Western, (materialistic) computational views? And how do these differing perspectives influence the very nature of the AI we create?
2. What does â€˜knowledgeâ€™ really mean in the context of AI? In Islam, we have a rich tradition of epistemology. How does this compare to the data-driven approach of modern machine learning? Can an AI system truly â€˜knowâ€™ something in the way that humans do? Can they â€˜understandâ€™ in the way human â€˜understandâ€™? What does â€˜understandingâ€™ even mean?
3. How do we evaluate the ethical implications of cutting-edge AI? From language models to autonomous systems, AI is advancing rapidly. How do we assess these technologies not just from a technical standpoint, but from an ethical and spiritual one? What unique insights can Islamic ethics offer to this discussion?
4. Is it possible to create AI systems that align with Islamic principles? As I work on AI systems, I often wonder: What would it mean to create a â€˜**tawhid-compatible**â€™ AI? Is it even possible to imbue machines with an *understanding* of spiritual concepts? (Look at Stuart Russellâ€™s â€˜human-compatible AIâ€™!)
5. How can we bridge the gap between Islamic scholarship and AI research? I see immense value in both fields, but they often seem to speak different languages. How can we foster meaningful collaboration between Islamic scholars and AI researchers?
6. What does the pursuit of AI mean for our understanding of human uniqueness? Islam teaches that humans have a special place in creation. As AI systems become more sophisticated, how do we reconcile this with our faith? What are the implications for concepts like free will and moral responsibility?

In the coming series of posts, *insha Allah*, Iâ€™ll delve into each of these areas, drawing on insights from both Islamic thought and recent AI development.

Hereâ€™s a tease of how the discussion might be unraveled, from high-level:

_Might be a continuation from [Kang Jurisâ€™ & Ustadz Wendiâ€™s paper](https://tafhim.ikim.gov.my/index.php/tafhim/article/view/176)._

These questions donâ€™t have easy answers. The concepts are hard to grasp, and even harder to be explained. But Iâ€™ll give my *initial* shots anyway.

Until then, I encourage you to also ponder these questions and consider how they might apply to your own understanding of AI and its place in our world.
