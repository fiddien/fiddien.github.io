Lately I‚Äôve been wondering if I've been asking for too much in my prayers. Some of my friends have asked the same question. *In this economy*, we find ourselves wishing for things we don‚Äôt have, don‚Äôt possess; some requests for ourselves, others for people we love.

But what does it mean to ask for ‚Äútoo much‚Äù of the One who created abundance itself?

### Walks & Wondering

The question crystallised during my usual evening walks after finishing a weekday workout, wandering the sidewalks near a park in between Jakarta‚Äôs streets. I always see people inside the park exercising, running, while I observe from the concrete boundary outside. In this urban landscape, there‚Äôs always a contrast. Those with access moving freely in green space, while others trace the harder edges.

Another evening, I noticed an elderly woman resting on the walking path, two large trash bags beside her. A trash picker, I presumed, carrying her survival in plastic sacks.

In another non-raining night, a man in crisp office clothes, perfectly neat, sleeping on his spread jacket under the soft shadow cast by street lamps. His sturdy backpack and substantial water bottle suggested purpose, preparation. Was he new to the city, seeking work? Had circumstances shifted suddenly? Or had exhaustion simply made the concrete sidewalk seem comfortable enough?

These walks reveal the spectrum of human need. People in states of lacking alongside people dwelling in wealth of choice and leisure and free energy spending, all of us taking space on the same streets.

Everyday, I return to shelter, safety, and the privilege of wondering rather than wanting. But did I earn this position through my own efforts? I may have worked hard since early age, made sacrifices ‚Äî albeit very few, relentlessly pursued education, built professional competence. Yet I also had stable family structure, parents who valued education, contexts where hard work could translate into advancement.

And what of those I observed? What structural factors shaped their circumstances? Different family configurations, different educational access, different health challenges, different economic disruptions where hard work doesn‚Äôt translate into advancement? The variables become too numerous and hidden to allow meaningful comparison. And no comparison coming from this limited human mind is ever fair and justified.

But at that time, as I recognised myself to fall into the more privileged side of the population, I was still wondering if I should asking less in my prayer, to be more content about what I already have, of what‚Äôs available, and instead, giving more.

And this turns out to be the most arrogant kind of wondering.

### The Question Behind the Question

So let‚Äôs go back to the question:

*Am I asking for too much in my prayer?*

Not whether I deserve more than others, but whether, when Allah has already provided me with comfort and security, it remains spiritually sound to ask for optimization. Better career prospects, increased wealth, the most suitable companion, advanced education opportunities.

Does **contentment** require accepting what‚Äôs easily within reach? Must **gratitude** limit **aspiration**?

But then I wonder; why must it be either-or? Why not both *ridha* and ambition? After all, *Jannah* itself represents our most ambitious target, and We wouldn‚Äôt ever know for sure if we‚Äôre going to die in a good state (*husnul khatimah*). If we can aspire toward the ultimate destination, we can also aspire toward the provisions He might grant along the way.

*‚ÄúAnd it is He who feeds but is never fed.‚Äù* (QS. Al-An‚Äôam 6:14)

Allah is The Sustainer. He provides for the elderly collector and the sleeping office worker just as He sustains me, just as He sustained the birds that neither sow nor reap, just as He sustained Yunus (as) in the belly of the whale when all seemed lost. Just as He sustained Yusuf (as) from his brother‚Äôs abandonment, to years of imprisonment, to financial control over the entire Egypt.

So why do I hesitate? If Allah provided for Yunus (as) in impossible darkness and elevated Yusuf from the lowest circumstances to the highest authority, what exactly am I protecting Him from by limiting my requests? No situation is too dire for His intervention, no aspiration too lofty for His consideration.

### Assumptions.. There‚Äôs Always Assumptions

Now I know I‚Äôve been approaching this backwards; instead of worrying about asking for too much, I should consider whether I‚Äôm underestimating the One I‚Äôm asking. When I approach Allah as if He operates under constraints; as if my requests might somehow burden or inconvenience Him; as if there‚Äôs a quota I might exceed; I‚Äôm not really acknowledging His actual nature, am I?

The unease I feel about ‚Äúasking for too much‚Äù might actually reveal assumptions I didn‚Äôt realize I was carrying.

**First assumption**: that there exists some ‚Äúcorrect amount‚Äù to request from the Infinite. This presupposes Allah operates within scarcity, that His provision follows human economics where taking more means others receive less. Yet His name, *Al-Waasi‚Äô*, the All-Encompassing, contains abundance that multiplies rather than diminishes when distributed.

**Second assumption**: that my worthiness should determine the scope of my supplications. This suggests I must somehow earn the right to approach Allah with significant requests. But worthiness in whose estimation? Mine? Society‚Äôs? The assumption crumbles when we consider that *Ar-Rahman* extends mercy because mercy flows from His very nature, not because we deserve it.

**Third assumption**: that asking for ‚Äútoo much‚Äù constitutes some form of spiritual impropriety or ingratitude. This assumes I can accurately assess what constitutes excess when addressing the One who created the very concept of ‚Äúmuch‚Äù and ‚Äúlittle.‚Äù How can this finite understanding measure His infinite capacity?

### Feeling Audacious

The assumptions felt most real when I found myself asking for what seemed like a second chance I didn‚Äôt deserve. Years earlier, I had squandered the first half of my undergraduate years through careless priorities and scattered focus. When the possibility of graduate study emerged, the request felt audacious: *Can someone who wasted her first educational opportunity really ask for admission to a world-class program? Is it appropriate to seek excellence when you‚Äôve demonstrated mediocrity?*

This internal voice whispered familiar refrains: *Others deserve this more. You had your chance and blew it. This level of education should go to students who maximized their first opportunities.* Yet when I finally made that supplication ‚Äî for a second chance, for access to transformative learning, for the scholarship that would make it possible ‚Äî while I also put the efforts (albeit, in my opinion, tiny little efforts) He provided years of purpose and growth that continue unfolding.

Those assumptions dissolved entirely in the face of what actually happened. And this makes me wonder, if I was so wrong about what I deserved then, what other limiting beliefs am I carrying now about what it‚Äôs acceptable to ask for?

But before I go into that line of thinking‚Ä¶ Of course, there‚Äôs also *adab* in making *du‚Äôa*.

### Guidance on Excess

Scholars have varying opinions about what‚Äôs the ‚Äòboundary‚Äô of one‚Äôs *du‚Äôa*. But for the sake of conciseness of this post, I‚Äôll take one as an initial guide. Imam Ibn Taymiyyah stated that two types of prayers are considered excessive:

1. Asking for what is exclusive to prophets. This includes praying for the ability to perform prophetic miracles or possess their unique characteristics, such as asking God to be an intercessor for your requests.
2. Asking for what is exclusive to God. This involves seeking divine attributes like knowing the unseen, having absolute power, or knowing everything.

He also considered prayers based on misguided beliefs to be excessive, such as believing that God needs your prayer, or that all of God‚Äôs servants would be in danger if you did not pray. He concluded that all of these examples are a result of ignorance regarding God‚Äôs rights and proper prayer etiquette.

Ultimately, the warnings from scholars like Imam Ibn Taymiyyah serve to guide our relationship with Allah, not to limit our requests. This is less about setting a cap on what‚Äôs acceptable to ask for; it‚Äôs more on defining the appropriate *adab* when we approach the Creator ‚Äî how shall we properly put ourselves, our heart‚Äôs wants and our prayers, in relation to Allah pertains to His Sifat and His Asma, and in relation to the prophets?

The real transgression isn‚Äôt in desiring a big career or greater wealth. After all, He is the Giver of all things. The transgression is when we forget our proper place in that relationship, like believing we can ask for things that are exclusive to Him or His prophets.

It brings to mind something a teacher once told me: we should even pray to Allah asking for Him for our breakfast, even after it‚Äôs already on the table. Why? Because the ‚Äòasking‚Äô isn‚Äôt just for the food‚Äôs quantity or taste (*zahir* and immediate aspect) let alone about whether it‚Äôs there or not, but in its ability to be nourishing, satisfying, and to bring *barakah* (*batin* and systemic aspect).

Prayer, then, becomes less about acquiring and more about acknowledging. It‚Äôs a continuous act of recognizing that every single thing, be it a morsel of food or a grand opportunity, is a gift from Him. The act of prayer is no less revealing than the content about our understanding of Allah‚Äôs infinite nature and our dependent place in His creation.

### The Privilege of Wondering

Then consider that we have the privilege of wondering about it at all.

The ability to wonder about asking for ‚Äútoo much‚Äù reveals how much has already been given. When basic needs are secure enough to permit philosophical questioning, when circumstances allow for contemplation of spiritual propriety, when the mind has space to examine its own assumptions about worthiness. These themselves are answers to prayers we may have forgotten making.

*The worry about asking for too much might actually stem from recognizing too little about what we already abundance of.*

Returning to those evening encounters, the elderly woman with her survival bundled in plastic sacks, the man sleeping beneath street lamps with purpose-filled belongings beside him. These individuals don‚Äôt diminish my right to ask; they amplify my responsibility **to ask well**. That my requests should expand beyond my own immediate circle. If *Al-Hakim* has positioned me to witness their circumstances, my supplications should encompass their needs alongside my own.

But asking well means asking completely. If we‚Äôre going to request better life prospects, shouldn‚Äôt we also **request the character** to use those opportunities without corruption? If we seek increased wealth, don‚Äôt we also **need the wisdom** to deploy it beyond accumulation? When we ask for the most suitable companion, shouldn‚Äôt we simultaneously **ask to become someone worthy** of that partnership?

Instead of limiting requests out of false humility, we expand them to include both provision and preparation. Ask for the opportunity AND the capacity to serve it well. Request the blessing AND the wisdom to recognize it properly. Seek advancement AND the strength to handle advancement without arrogance.

This is a self-reminder that **effectiveness** matters. Someone equipped with resources, education, and opportunity can address problems beyond their immediate circle. The question becomes less ‚Äúdo I deserve this‚Äù and more ‚Äúhow can I become someone who could steward this responsibly.‚Äù

### We‚Äôre Invited!

Allah is the One who created scarcity and abundance, who determines both limitation and expansion, who knows precisely what serves His purposes in each moment. He invites the asking. *‚ÄúCall upon Me; I will answer you.‚Äù* No conditions specified, no upper limits mentioned, no worthiness requirements outlined. The verse doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúCall upon Me with modest requests‚Äù or ‚ÄúCall upon Me if you‚Äôve earned it‚Äù or ‚ÄúCall upon Me but don‚Äôt get carried away.‚Äù

He knows that genuine preparation for His provisions naturally expands our concern beyond ourselves. The person ready to receive much is the person who has learned to think beyond their own receiving.

It is also a recognition that every person I encountered carried needs I couldn‚Äôt fully understand, dreams deferred, circumstances constrained. And that the same Allah who provided for me, who opened doors I thought closed, who continues answering prayers I never thought to make, He holds all of it within His knowledge and power.

This is what I mean when I say He always gives me more than I ask. Not just more in quantity, but more in perspective, more in understanding, more in capacity to ask better questions.

> ‚ÄúO tranquil soul! Return to your Lord, well pleased Àπwith HimÀ∫ and well pleasing Àπto HimÀ∫. So join My servants, and enter My Paradise.‚Äù

(QS. Al-Fajr 89: 27‚Äì30)
