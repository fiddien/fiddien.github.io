To my ultimate love, I live to pay my debts

that cannot ever be fully paid.

Even with those lush colours,

and that gushing body of water,

the depth of my vision

is still unable

to reconcile the width of gaps

between your presence and my grasp.

It is not measurable

for how long I have forgotten

the answer to your question.

But here and now

I wish to never stop bearing a witness

and declaring You as my only necessary.
