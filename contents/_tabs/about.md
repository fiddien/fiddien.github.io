Call her [Ilma](). She is a human and a full-time learner. One side of her is that she is a muslim women ðŸ§• with [mathematics](https://math.itb.ac.id/) training from [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://www.itb.ac.id/) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© and now studying at [MSc Speech and Language Processing](https://www.ed.ac.uk/c/slp-pg-online-info) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. The other side is that she's a persistent believer of the uniqueness and complexity of each human being. No person can be described so simply like a few sentences you just read before.

[This blog](/blog) is the place where she tries to connect the dots from her learning--reflecting about life and [stuffs](/tags). Sometimes she writes in [Medium](https:/fiddien.medium.com) too.

The notion of "understanding the underlying principle of intelligence" fascinates her. She want to dig deep into the *why*, *how*, and *what* is intelligence.  That's why she's very into philosophy, psychology, language, spirituality, and technology; the areas that have something to say about intelligence.
