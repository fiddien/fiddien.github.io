This is Ilma Aliya Fiddien. I‚Äôm a human and a full-time learner. One side of me is that I am a Muslimah üßï with mathematics training from Institut Teknologi Bandung üáÆüá© and now studying at MSc Speech and Language Processing at the University of Edinburgh üá¨üáß. The other side is that I‚Äôm a persistent believer of the uniqueness and complexity of each one of us. No person can be described so simply like I just did in a few sentences before.

The notion of ‚Äúunderstanding the underlying principle of intelligence‚Äù fascinates me. I want to dig deep into the why, how, and what is intelligence.

With this interest at heart, now I am studying mathematics and artificial intelligence; particularly invested in graphs/networks, deep learning, and natural language processing. I believe all kinds of languages‚Äîverbal, physical, or abstract‚Äîare the manifestation of intelligence.

I‚Äôm also keen to discuss topics such as personal leadership, philosophy, psychology, history, spirituality and religious studies. This blog is the place where I tried to connect the dots while I'm learning.
