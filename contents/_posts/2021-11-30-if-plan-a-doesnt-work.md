They told her she’s a planning master. Always looked so prepared and have everything under her belt. In fact, she has so many things to be unsure of. Abundant planning is just a way of coping with the nagging feeling that everything she has prepared can be erroneous and fall all over in front of her.

And if things don’t go her way, then let it be. Let her make another change. Because she always has another contingency plan.

It’s all that persistence that keeps them standing. Nothing less, but probably more things are actually helping them, at least they believe so. Tell them to reason and to listen, and if they do so and do not disagree, it’s going to be a full drive, unstoppable push in one direction.

Yes, they admit that they do not have any special going on. Today is just another normal day and every one of them is just another average human. It’s their collective determination that is on another level.

That “why”, he held it so tightly. That’s why he always believe in the next thing, the next second, the next breath, the next chance, the next failure, the next forgiveness, the next rebirth of the sun, and even the next most extraordinary event he will ever face after being born: death.

No discriminations between all imaginable conditions, until the ultimate judge has been sent down upon him.
