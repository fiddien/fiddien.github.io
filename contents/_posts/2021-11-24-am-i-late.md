Let me get to the point.

There is only one thing that can be categorised as *definitively late*:

> Want to do more good after you can’t do it.

If you think it is too late to start something, try to ask: *Can you do it now? Can you do the thing in some measurable steps in the future?*

Don’t think beyond that, it’s a yes-or-no question.

First, if it’s a **no**, I’d like you to think again about these five conditions: your wealth, your time, your health, your faith, and your life. In general, it is easier to control your wealth (mainly about earning-spending balance) than control your time. It is also easier to control your time than control your health. It is easier to control your health than your faith. It is easier to control your faith than the fate of your life. So, if your conditions are generally fine with that five things, you are still resourceful in doing whatever you think you are late for. It’s not late. Not until you get broke, you get too much old to move, you get sick, you get crazy (intellectually or spiritually), or you die.

But! If the answer is **yes, you can do it, then you are not late to do it**.

Yes, that’s it. Enough arguing. Let’s start.
