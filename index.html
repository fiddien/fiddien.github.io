<p>Call her <a href="">Ilma</a>. She is a human and a full-time learner. One side of her is that she is a muslim women ðŸ§• with <a href="https://math.itb.ac.id/">mathematics</a> training from <a href="https://www.itb.ac.id/">Bandung Institute of Technology</a> ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© and now studying at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/c/slp-pg-online-info">MSc Speech and Language Processing</a> at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a> ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. The other side is that she&#39;s a persistent believer of the uniqueness and complexity of each human being. No person can be described so simply like a few sentences you just read before.</p>
<p><a href="/blog">This blog</a> is the place where she tries to connect the dots from her learning--reflecting about life and <a href="/tags">stuffs</a>. Sometimes she writes in <a href="https:/fiddien.medium.com">Medium</a> too.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Read: In the name of your Lord Who created, created human from a clot. Read: And your Lord is the Most Generous, Who taught by the pen, taught human that which he knew not.&quot;</em> --QS 96:19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The notion of &quot;understanding the underlying principle of intelligence&quot; fascinates her. She want to dig deep into the <em>why</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>what</em> is intelligence.  That&#39;s why she&#39;s very into philosophy, psychology, language, spirituality, and technology; the areas that have something to say about intelligence.</p>
